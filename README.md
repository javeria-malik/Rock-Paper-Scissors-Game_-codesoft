Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Code Explanation
This Python code implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows a user to play against the computer. Below is an explanation of the code's key components:
User Input (user_choice function):
The user_choice function uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
It validates the input and returns the user's choice once a valid option is entered.
Computer Selection (computer_choice function):
The computer_choice function randomly selects a choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer using the random.choice function.
Game Logic (winner function):
The winner function determines the winner of a round based on the user's choice and the computer's choice.
It checks for ties and compares the user's choice to the computer's choice to declare the winner.
Gameplay Loop (play function):
The play function manages the gameplay loop. It initializes user and computer scores.
Within the loop, it repeatedly asks for the user's choice, computer's choice, and determines the round winner.
The user's and computer's scores are updated accordingly.
After each round, it asks the user if they want to play again. The loop continues if the user chooses "yes" and exits if they choose "no."
Execution (if __name__ == "__main__":):

The code block under if __name__ == "__main__": serves as the entry point of the program.
It welcomes the user to the game and calls the play function to start the game.
The game allows for multiple rounds, keeps track of the user's and computer's scores, and provides feedback to the user after each round. Players can decide whether to continue playing or exit the game.
